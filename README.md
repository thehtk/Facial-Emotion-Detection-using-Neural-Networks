# Facial-Emotion-Detection-using-Neural-Networks
Facial Emotion Detection using Neural Networks has scope in many areas such as human-computer interaction, biometric security provides insight into AI and ML that uses variously supervised and unsupervised machine-learning algorithms to simulate the human brain. It plays a very important role in nonverbal communication which appears due to the internal feelings of a person that reflects on the faces and we determine it using this project.
